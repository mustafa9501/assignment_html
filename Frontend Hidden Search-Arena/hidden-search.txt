Frontend Hidden Search
You have to implement a simple search button which expands and displays the input search bar on clicking, as shown in the image below.
In the project boilerplate, you are given a div with an id searchbar.

When not clicked, the searchbar should have width of 100px. It should have a input tag of width 0px and search button of 100px.

On clicking the button, the searchbar should widen to 400px. The input tag should have width 300px, and search button's width should stay the same at 100px.

Also, make sure that input element gets focused when button is clicked.

Note: Inside the searchbar div, the input tag should have an id "search-input" and the button should have the id "search-btn".
